ECE747 NANOPHOTONICS COURSE - UW MADISON, FALL 2020

This repository documents HW problems and assignments solved for this course. Intention is to share the MATLAB codes, Inkscape files, etc relevant to this course.
I have used the terms Home Work (HW) and Practice Set (PS) interchangably. Apologies for that.
