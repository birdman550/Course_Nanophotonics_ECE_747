ECE747 NANOPHOTONICS COURSE - UW MADISON, FALL 2020

This repository documents HW problems and assignments solved for this course. Intention is to share the MATLAB codes, Inkscape files, etc relevant to this course.
I have used the terms Home Work (HW) and Problem Set (PS) interchangably. Apologies for that.

There are a total of 3 HW Problem Sets, 1 In-Class Presentation, and 1 Final Project.

Final Project topic: Optical Tweezers
In-Class Presentation topic: Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
